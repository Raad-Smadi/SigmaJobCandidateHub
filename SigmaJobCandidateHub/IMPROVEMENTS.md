• List of ways for improvement:

1) Authentication and Authorization:

    Implement a robust authentication and authorization system, such as OAuth 2.0 or OpenID Connect, for securing your APIs.

2) Caching Strategy:
    
    Use distributed caching (e.g., Redis) for better scalability, especially if the application runs in a distributed environment or multiple instances.

3) Layered Architecture:

    Split the project into separate layers, such as Data Access, Business Logic, and API/Controller layers. This makes the code more maintainable and testable.

4) Microservices Architecture:

    As the project grows, consider breaking it down into microservices. Each microservice can handle a specific business capability (e.g., Candidate Management) and communicate with others via APIs or gRPC. This allows for independent scaling and deployment.

5) Message Queuing:

    Implement message queues (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka) to decouple services and handle high-throughput, distributed processing.

• List of assumptions:

1) Scaling Needs: 

    The project may eventually need to handle a large number of users, transactions, and data volume, so considerations for scalability are important.

2) Team Expansion: 

    As the project grows, more developers may join, so the codebase needs to be easily understandable, maintainable, and well-documented.

3) Data Sensitivity: 

    The project may handle sensitive data, so security measures such as encryption and access control will become increasingly important.

4) High Availability: 

    The project may require high availability, so redundancy, load balancing, and disaster recovery plans should be considered.
